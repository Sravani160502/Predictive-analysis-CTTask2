Task Description : 
As part of my internship at CodTech, Task 2 involved executing a predictive analysis using machine learning to solve a real-world classification problem. The objective was to develop a model capable of predicting whether employees would achieve their Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), based on a variety of workplace and performance-related features. I began by exploring and preprocessing an employee performance dataset, which contained attributes such as department, recruitment source, training hours, awards won, previous year rating, length of service, and average training score. After handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, I applied feature scaling to optimize the model's performance. I chose the Random Forest Classifier as the machine learning algorithm due to its robustness, ability to handle mixed data types, and strong performance in classification tasks. The dataset was split into training and testing subsets to evaluate model generalizability. Initially, I trained the baseline model and observed its performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The initial model reached an accuracy of around 72%, indicating a reasonably good prediction capability. To further enhance the model, I engaged in hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, testing various combinations of estimators, depth, and split criteria to identify the best model configuration. Throughout this process, I gained hands-on experience with important machine learning concepts such as data wrangling, feature importance, class distribution, and model evaluation techniques. I analyzed the importance of each feature in predicting KPI achievement and visualized key insights using plots such as confusion matrices and feature importance graphs. I also examined overfitting and underfitting behaviors by evaluating training and testing scores across different model variations. My work extended beyond just building a predictive modelâ€”it involved aligning machine learning solutions with business objectives by identifying what attributes most influence employee success. This approach provides actionable insights for human resource strategies, helping organizations focus on factors that significantly impact performance. Overall, this task not only helped me strengthen my understanding of classification models and Random Forests but also emphasized the importance of business relevance in data science projects. The experience I gained from model optimization, practical data handling, and performance tuning was integral to building a deployable and insightful solution. Task 2 thus served as a comprehensive learning opportunity, combining technical skills with business acumen in a real-world predictive analysis scenario.
